<b>This depository contains Iris dataset analysis using Python.</b>

Student: Mantvydas Jokubaitis

Summary: Iris flower data set is a multivariable data set collected by Sir Ronald Aylmer Fisher and published in journal article 'The Use of Multiple Measurements in Taxonomic Problems.' in Annals of Eugenics, 7 in 1936. Data set contain biological data of Iris flower and is divided by species into Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor.
Dataset contains 150 observations altogether, 50 observations for each species. Features include length and width of sepal and petal, also Iris species name.

Analysis on this dataset will be performed using Python, that is a powerful high level programming language. Various Python packages will be used to explore and summarise the findings.
